### Homework feedback

- Think about responsibility. Fx in the RedditPost
- This
- getPerimeter vs perimeter
- What to do in the constructor. Where should i initialize the arraylist in RedditFrontPage



### Modelling exercise

DSB has contacted us regarding creating a ticket scanner for a train conductor in a train

A ticket has an owner, a from and to station, a start date and a finish date

An owner has a fullname, age and a picture

The ticket scanner should scan peoples tickets and have a list of all the scanned tickets. It should be able to remove tickets. The scanner should at all time be able to report how many people are on a train. 

The scanner should be able to check if a ticket is valid or not. If a ticket is not valid it should not be added to the tickets list

Let's first 

1. Model first (attributes, constructor and empty methods)
2. Then implement functionality

## Exercises



### Modelling



#### Book store - level 2

Problem Description:

A book store wants to create a program that will run as the cash register

Different types of books like fiction, non-fiction, science fiction, and fantasy are sold at the store. 

The cash register should be able to create a receipt where books can be added or removed from the receipt. It should be possible to get total price of the receipt and there should be a function to print a receipt.

Model the classes (with attributes and methods) needed to represent the books and receipts. Create some books and receipts and see if your program works! 

Consider using inheritance, abstract or interfaces if you think it is relevant



#### Customer - level 3

If a person that buys some book are a customer it should be possible for that customer to earn points when buying a book. You decide how many points a customer should get when buying a book. Let the customer claim their points to get a discount when buying books
